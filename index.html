    <p style="padding-left: 20%; max-width: 60%;"><br>My name is Abby Shanker, and during my Junior year, I took AP Computer Science Principles.
        Last year, I took AP Computer Science A, which focused on the application of Java. I decided
        to take AP Computer Science Principles because I wanted to gain a better understanding of
        the foundation of computer science. I really liked the AP Computer Science Principles curriculum.
        Since I took the Java class before the principles class, it was difficult to combine learning
        a new programming language with learning the logic of computer science. After taking this course,
        I feel more prepared to take a rigorous computer science course. I gained an in-depth understanding
        of the principles that are fundamental to understanding new coding languages.

        <br><br><br>
        In this portfolio, I have included my Performance Task for the AP Computer Science Principles exam,
        a password generator, a game design project and segments of code that reflect my skills. I have also included a reflection on my experience
        in this course.
        <br><br>Enjoy!
